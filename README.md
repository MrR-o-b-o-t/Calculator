## Summary

This project was a turning point for me. Everyone builds a calculator app, but not many do so only using vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone and dive deeper into JavaScript, my overall ability to use logic to solve problems, and write clean code. So, I built this calculator! This calculator allows you to perform addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction using multiple digits, and allows the use of decimal points.
